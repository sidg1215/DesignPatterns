# Design Patterns Guide: Get rid of your "smelly" code for good!

This guide is for anyone who wants to make their codebase more extensible and useable. It has been divided into three separate sections. You may check out them based on your own needs.

All the code examples are written in Java, however the logic and idea can be applied to any OOP language of your choice.

These are the sections of the guide:
* To add more extensibility and usablity in the ways objects are created and modified in your codebase, check out [Creational Design Patterns](https://github.com/sidg1215/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Creational%20Patterns)
* To add more extensibility and usablity in the ways features and behavior are added in your codebase, check out [Behavioral Design Patterns](https://github.com/sidg1215/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Patterns)
* To add more extensibility and usablity in the ways different classes (either in your codebase or not) work with each other in your codebase, check out [Structural Patterns](https://github.com/sidg1215/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Structural%20Patterns)
