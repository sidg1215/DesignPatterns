# Design Patterns Cheat Sheet

This guide is for anyone who wants to know of different techniques to refactor their codebase, and it has been divided into three separate sections. You may consult them based on your own needs.

All the code examples are written in Java, however the logic and idea can be applied to any OOP language of your choice.

These are the sections of the guide:
* To streamline the creation and modification process of objects in your codebase, consult [Creational Patterns](https://github.com/sidg1215/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Creational%20Patterns)
* To make adding features and behavior to your codebase easier and more extensible, consult [Behavioral Patterns](https://github.com/sidg1215/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Patterns)
* To make adding the ability for different structures to work with each other easier and more extensible, consult [Structural Patterns](https://github.com/sidg1215/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Structural%20Patterns)
