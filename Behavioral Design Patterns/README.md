# Behavioral Patterns
## What are Behavioral Patterns?
When developers are trying to add more "behavior" (adding addional features, a new view, new commands, etc.) to their codebase, they have to modify a lot of existing code to try and make sure that adding new behavior does not break old features. If done incorrectly, this process is time consuming and it only makes adding more features in the codebase in the future much harder (since there is more code to manage now!).

Luckily, there is a way to get around this problem. Behavioral design patterns can be used when adding more behavior to a codebase, and it will also make the process of adding more features to the codebase in the future much more easier and intuitive.

These are two common behavioral design patterns:
* [Command Design Pattern](https://github.com/sidg1215/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Design%20Patterns/Command%20Design%20Pattern) : Use this desgin pattern to make adding "Commands" to your application more flexible.
* [Iterator Design Pattern](https://github.com/sidg1215/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Design%20Patterns/Iterator%20Design%20Pattern) : Use this design pattern to iterate over different types of data structures.
