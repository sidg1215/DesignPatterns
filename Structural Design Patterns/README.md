# Structural Design Patterns
## What are Structural Dseign Patterns?
Reusability is important in software. Often times it is extremely inefficient for developers to create code from scratch, which is why they resort to using code from other developers (code from other libraries). However, integrating code from from other libraries into your codebase is not always straightforward.

Structural design patterns are design patterns that make it easier (and oftentimes, make it possible!) to integrate code from other libraries into your codebase. Not only that, structural design patterns can be used to help organize the hierarchy of classees to make it more streamlined, understandable, and extensible.

These are two structural patterns that show you how you can make your codebase more robust:
* [Adapter Desing Pattern](https://github.com/sidg1215/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Structural%20Design%20Patterns/Adapter%20Design%20Pattern) : Use this design pattern when you are trying to add an interface or class from a third-party developer or other library into your codebase.
* [Bridge Design Pattern](https://github.com/sidg1215/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Structural%20Design%20Patterns/Bridge%20Design%20Pattern) : Use this design pattern when you are trying to make it easier to add more classes which resemble combinations of different structures
