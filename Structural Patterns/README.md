# Structural Patterns
## What are Structural Patterns?
The idea of reusability is important in the world of software development, and often times it is very time consuming and inefficient for developers to create code from scratch, which means that that the need for third-party codebases is necessary. Structural design patterns are patterns that allow a developer to expand their codebase by using classes, interfaces, implementations, and functionalities from other codebases.

A very common structural design pattern is the [Adapter pattern](https://github.com/sidg1215/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Structural%20Patterns/Adapter%20Pattern), which is described in this guide.
