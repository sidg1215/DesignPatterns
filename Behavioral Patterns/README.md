# Behavioral Patterns
## What are Behavioral Patterns?
Often times, when developers are trying to create new "behavior" (adding addional features, a new view, new commands, etc.), they have to modify a lot of existing code to try and make sure that adding new behavior does not break old code. This process is time consuming, and it often-times does not make sure that adding future features will be easy.

Enter: Behavioral Patterns. Behavioral design patterns are used when trying to make adding behavior to a codebase more extensible and easier to do.

These are two behavioral patterns that show you how you can make your codebase more extensible:
* [Command Pattern](https://github.com/sidg1215/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Patterns/Command%20Pattern) : Use this pattern if you want to make adding "Commands" to your application more flexible.
* [Iterator Pattern](https://github.com/sidg1215/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Patterns/Iterator%20Pattern) : Use this pattern if you want to iterate over different types of data structures.
